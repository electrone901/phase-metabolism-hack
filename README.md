# How it's made
Every user has a Phase Profile, which is an NFT contract that stores their username, avatar, banner image, bio, and an arbitrary number of links.

Users can see eachothers' basic profile and can follow to see links. The symbol for the Phase Profile NFT contract is the username of the owner.
